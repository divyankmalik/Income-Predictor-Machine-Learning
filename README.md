# Income-Predictor-Machine-Learning
The project involves creating a predictive model to estimate individuals' income based on factors such as work industry, age, and education level, utilizing datasets from Kaggle.com within a Jupyter Notebook environment. To facilitate data manipulation, I employed **Pandas**, allowing for effective handling of data, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). For visualizations, I used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, which helped me create informative graphs to understand income distributions and relationships between various factors.

To build the predictive model, I implemented **Scikit-learn**, which is essential for machine learning tasks. Specifically, I imported the **RandomForestClassifier** from `sklearn.ensemble` to create a robust classification model. The random forest algorithm is particularly effective for handling complex datasets with multiple features, as it builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions for better accuracy and control overfitting. I also used `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to divide the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring that I could evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.

The project involved several steps: data preprocessing, including normalization and encoding categorical variables; model training using the Random Forest classifier; and performance evaluation through metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Throughout this process, I applied cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. Ultimately, the project aimed to provide insights into the socio-economic factors influencing income levels while enhancing my data science and machine learning skills.
