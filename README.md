# Income-Predictor-Machine-Learning
The project creates a predictive model to estimate income based on work industry, age, and education using Kaggle data in Jupyter Notebook. I utilized **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** for visualizations, and **Scikit-learn** for model building, enhancing my data science skills while exploring socio-economic influences on income.
